# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for `pdgen`, a tool designed to transform your Python code into UML class diagrams. `pdgen` aims to streamline the visualization process for developers, architects, and analysts, allowing them to better understand and communicate the structure of their software.

## What is pdgen?

`pdgen` is a Python library that automatically generates UML class diagrams from Python codebases. It parses your Python files, identifies classes, methods, attributes, and their relationships, and then renders these elements into a UML class diagram.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Diagram Generation**: Automatically generate diagrams from your Python code without the need for manual setup.
- **Support for Complex Hierarchies**: Understand complex inheritance and composition relationships with clear and accurate diagrams.
- **Customizable Output**: Tailor the output to fit your needs with various configuration options that control diagram layout, color schemes, and more.
- **Integration Friendly**: Easily integrate with existing projects or workflows to generate diagrams as part of your documentation process.

## Why Use pdgen?

Using `pdgen` can significantly enhance your development process by providing several benefits:

- **Improved Code Understanding**: Quickly get a visual overview of your code's structure, which is especially useful for onboarding new developers or analyzing legacy code.
- **Better Design Decisions**: By visualizing the architecture, you can identify design flaws and improve your software's overall structure and performance.
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Automatically generated diagrams serve as an excellent addition to your project's documentation, helping others understand your architectural decisions.
